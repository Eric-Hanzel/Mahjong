Mahjong game

Our project is mainly based on the basic game logic of mahjong and communication between client and server to develop.

After pulling our project, please debug the maven dependencies, which mainly require java and JavafX-related libraries
Note that you may need to go into module Settings to adjust the scope of maven dependencies to compile time.

Then run the server first, and then open four more clients to join the game can be simulated in the local four players online play.
If you want to play together on different devices, adjust the ip and port numbers of the client and server to play online.

Due to limited time, this mahjong game project only supports a maximum of 4 players to play at the same time.
